## Hugo

Static website generator:  

- Installed automatically when you install blogdown
- Great software, except missing support for Rmarkdown files  

Blogdown builds on Hugo's speed and reliability to enable creation of websites in R!  

## blogdown

Functionality through the 'addins' dropdown menu next to the panes button:  

- Serve Site: Live, local preview of your website
- New Post
- Update Metadata: Conveniently edit the YAML of an existing post
- Insert Image

## blogdown cont.

Rmarkdown support allows for all the features we know and love, including:  

- Executeable R code chunks
- LaTeX math typesetting
- HTML Widgets and Shiny Apps
- Inline formatting e.g. subscripts and footnotes

However, you suffer some decrease in speed by using Rmarkdown compared to markdown.

## Reccomended workflow

1. Pick a [Theme](http://themes.gohugo.io)
2. Create a new project in Rstudio and call blogdown::new_site(theme = 'user/repo')
3. Edit the config.toml options
4. Edit the site: click the "Serve Site" Addin to view your website in Rstudio
5. Use the "New Post" Addin to create a new post, and create its content
6. Use the "Update Metadata" Addin to change the options for your post
7. Host your site!

## Deployment/Hosting

Once you've created your website locally, you need to host it on a server for the world to see.
There are a few options for free hosting services, but the authors reccomend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
