```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Let's go explore!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\lac.jpg")

```
We are leaving the comfortable world of causal inference into the world of prediction. In math terms we are no longer thinking about the $\hat\beta$ in $\hat{y_i}=\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1*x_i+\epsilon_i$ but instead about $\hat{y}$.


## What is Cross Validation (CV)?

CV is a resampling method used to compare how good different predictive models are at predicting an outcome $\hat{y}$. "Good" is defined as finding the predictive model with the smallest MSE or MAE. We are briefly going to discuss three methods of CV:

- Validation Set Approach (Holdout Method)

- Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

- K-folds cross validation

## Some quick definitions/concepts

- Training data: The "seen" data from our data set on which we train our predictive model

- Test data: The unseen data from our data set on which we apply our model from the training data to measure performance

- Bias/variance tradeoff: The tradeoff between underfitting the data (bias) vs overfitting the data (variance) with our predictive models


## Validation Set Approach (Holdout Method)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\holdout.jpg")

```

- Divide our dataset into a training set and a test set

- Train and test our models

## Validation Set Approach (Holdout Method)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\holdout_test.jpg")

```


## Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px"}


```

## K-folds cross validation

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px"}


```
