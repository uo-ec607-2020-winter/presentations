## Spark, an introduction
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\spark_logo_2x.png")
```

- Spark is open source unified analytics engine that assists with data processing and machine learning.

- Derived from Hadoop (we will talk about differences in a second)

- Developed at UC Berkeley in 2009

- Apache is its caretaker now, checks out some of their other open source programs!

## What is Hadoop?

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\hadoop.jpg")

```

- Allows for the processing of big data across clusters of computers 

- Your data and applications are safe with Hadoop thanks to distributed computing

- Every machine spun up offers local computation and storage to disk

## So why Spark?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\speed.jpg")
```

- SPEED! Spark was designed to be much faster than Hadoop. It does this by saving fewer operations to disk, and using RAM.

- Spark is available in multiple programming languages (SQL, Java, Python, Scala)

- Spark uses Hadoop for storage only, uses seperate clusters for computation

## Other benefits of Spark

- Real time processing, which allows for processing of streaming data. This also provides instantaneuous results.

- Spark is extremely useful for machine learning. (Sit in on Ed's class next year!!! With his permission of course)

- Spark is really useful for graph algorithms (GraphX) and unites exploratory graph analysis, iterative graph computation, and ETL (extract, transform, load) under one roof.

## Who cares?

- Many major companies like Yahoo!, Amazon, and ebay use Spark

- Saves time, that's pretty precious

- Grant will say you should care so you should, otherwise face his wrathful glare

```{r, r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px" }
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Jake\\Desktop\\Skool\\Grant Class\\presentations\\jake_schefrin_spark_files\\figure-html\\tarkin.jpg")

```
