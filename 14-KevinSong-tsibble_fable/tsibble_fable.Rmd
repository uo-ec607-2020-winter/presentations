## 1) tsibble

```{r t1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tsibble")
```

> **tsibble** package provides a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools adapting tidy data principles.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- tsibble is a data- and model-oriented object. 

- In tsibble:

  1. **Key** is a set of variables that define observational units over time.

  2. **Index** is a variable with inherent ordering from past to present.

  3. Each observation should be uniquely identified by **key** and **index**.

  4. Each observational unit should be measured at a common **interval**, if regularly spaced.

---

# Coerce to a tsibble - as_tsibble()

> To coerce data frame to tsibble, we need to declare **key** and **index**. 

- The **key** can be comprised of empty, one, or more variables. 
  - For multiple variables, declare `key = c(x1, x2, x3)`. 
  - can be created in conjunction with tidy selectors like `starts_with()`
  
- The **Index** supports an extensive range of indices 
    - native time classes in R (Date, POSIXct and difftime)
    - tsibble's new additions (yearweek, yearmonth, and yearquarter)

- The **Interval** is computed from index based on the representation.

|Inverval |Class|
|---------|-----|
|Annual   | interger/double |
|Quarterly| yearquarter |
|Monthly  | yearmonth |
|Weekly   | yearweek |
|Daily (Subdaily) | Date / difftime ( POSIXt / difftime / hms )|

# Ex) nycflights13::weather

- `time_hour` containing the date-times should be declared as **index**

- `origin` should be declared as **key**. 

- Other columns can be considered as measured variables. 

```{r t2_1, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(1,2)}
weather <- nycflights13::weather %>% 
  select(origin, time_hour, temp, humid, precip)

weather
```

---

# Ex) nycflights13::weather

- `time_hour` containing the date-times should be declared as **index**

- `origin` should be declared as **key**. 

- Other columns can be considered as measured variables. 

```{r t2_2, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(1,2)}
weather_tsbl <- as_tsibble(weather, 
                           key = origin, #<<
                           index = time_hour) #<<
weather_tsbl
```
---

# fill_gaps()

> **fill_gaps()** turns implicit missing values into explicit.

- If the observations are made at regular time interval, we could turn these implicit missingness to be explicit simply using `fill_gaps()`.

- `fill_gaps()` also handles filling in time gaps by values or functions, and respects time zones for date-times.

```{r t3, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(1,2,3)}
full_weather <- weather_tsbl %>%
  fill_gaps(precip = 0) %>% #<<  
#filling gaps in precip with 0
  group_by_key() %>% 
  tidyr::fill(temp, humid, .direction = "down") 
#replaces NAs with its previous observation for each origin (key)

full_weather
```

---

# index_by() + summarise()

> **`index_by()`** + **`summarise()`** to aggregate over calendar periods

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- `index_by()` is the counterpart of `group_by()` in temporal context, but it groups the index only. 

- In conjunction with `index_by()`, **`summarise()`** and its scoped variants aggregate variables over calendar periods.

- `index_by()` goes hand in hand with the index functions including `as.Date()`, `yearweek()`, `yearmonth()` and `yearquarter()`, as well as other friends from `lubridate`. 

---

# index_by() + summarise()

**Example**) To compute average temperature and total precipitation *per month*, we can apply `yearmonth()` to the index variable (referred to as .).

  - While collapsing rows (by `summarise()`), `group_by()` and `index_by()` take care of updating the key and index respectively.

```{r t4, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(3, 4)}
full_weather %>%
  group_by_key() %>%
  index_by(year_month = ~ yearmonth(.)) %>% # monthly aggregates
  summarise(
    avg_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    ttl_precip = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

# Rolling with slide(), tile(), stretch()

- Several functions in tsibble allow for different variations of moving windows using purrr-like syntax:

  - `slide()`: sliding window with overlapping observations.
  - `tile()`: tiling window without overlapping observations.
  - `stretch()`: fixing an initial window and expanding to include more observations.

## 2) fable

```{r f1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fable")
```

> **fable** package provides a collection of commonly used univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Forecasing models include exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling.

- These models work within the fable framework, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.

---

# Example

```{r f2, eval=FALSE}
p_load(fable, tsibble, tsibbledata, lubridate, dplyr, feast)

aus_retail %>%
  filter(
    State %in% c("New South Wales", "Victoria"),
    Industry == "Department stores"
  ) %>% 
  model(
    ets = ETS(box_cox(Turnover, 0.3)),
    arima = ARIMA(log(Turnover)),
    snaive = SNAIVE(Turnover)
  ) %>%
  forecast(h = "2 years") %>% 
  autoplot(filter(aus_retail, year(Month) > 2010), level = NULL)
```
